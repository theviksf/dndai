## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack**: React with TypeScript, Vite, and Wouter for routing.
**UI Framework**: Shadcn UI built on Radix UI primitives, styled with Tailwind CSS, featuring a D&D-themed design with parchment textures and a fantasy color palette.
**State Management**: React hooks for local state, TanStack Query for server state and API caching.
**Component Structure**:
- **Home page**: Main game interface with expanded character stats, narrative panel, and tabbed info panel (inventory, spells, quests, companions, NPCs, history).
- **Settings page**: LLM configuration (Primary, Parser, Backstory), API key input, custom prompt editing (DM, Parser, Character Image, Location Image, Backstory), and game settings (auto-save, auto-generate images, auto-generate backstories).
- **Character Creation page**: Multi-step character generation with optional file import feature allowing users to skip manual creation by uploading a .ogl save game file (character is extracted from the save).
- **CharacterStatsBar**: Modern, organized stats display with improved UX. Features larger character portrait with ring border, serif typography, Level badge with Sparkles icon. Core stats section shows HP/XP bars with colored badges, Gold with gradient background and weekly income, Location with portrait. Bottom row displays all 6 attributes (STR/DEX/CON/INT/WIS/CHA) always visible inline with modifiers, AC with Shield icon, status effects as badges, and week counter showing turn progress (Turn X/15 ‚Ä¢ Week Y format). Uses Shadcn Badges and Separators for modern D&D-themed design. Responsive flex layout works on all devices.
- **NarrativePanel**: Displays AI-generated story progress, supports Markdown rendering (GFM), and includes a custom action text input.
- **GameInfoTabs**: Tabbed interface with 8 tabs (Inventory, Spells, Locations, Business, Quests, Party, NPCs, History). Features notification badges that pulse when parser updates a tab, clearing when opened. Spells tab includes search filtering, level filtering, and sorting by name/level/school with compact card layout. NPCs tab displays sex/gender and relationship status (-3 to +3 scale) with color-coded text. All tabs have consistent icons.
- **EntityDetailSheet**: Wide modal panel (sm:max-w-7xl) with side-by-side layout - image on left (40%), content on right (60%). Features serif typography for headings, larger readable fonts, and improved spacing. Status displays as colored badges ("Alive" in green with Heart icon, "Dead" in red with Skull icon). Relationship shows as colored text labels (Neutral/Warm/Friendly/Devoted or Cold/Unfriendly/Hostile), not numeric values. All entities support in-place editing. Supports NPCs, companions, quests, locations, and businesses. Quest panel displays title with icon, type badge (‚öîÔ∏è Main Quest/üìú Side Quest), description, objectives with checkboxes, progress tracking, and backstory when available. **Character Stats Section**: For main character only, displays comprehensive stats after basic info - HP/XP bars with inline editing, Gold with weekly income from businesses, all 6 attributes (STR/DEX/CON/INT/WIS/CHA) in 3x2 grid with calculated modifiers, AC with Shield icon, and active status effects with turn counters. Includes safety guards for undefined attribute values (defaults to 10).
- **Header Navigation**: Modern, organized header with clean 3-element design:
  - Cost Tracker (HoverCard showing detailed token usage and costs)
  - Save Game button (primary action)
  - Game Menu (DropdownMenu) organizing all actions into logical sections:
    - Game Actions: New Game, Undo Last Turn
    - Data Management: Export Save, Import Save, Storage Stats display
    - System: View Debug Log, Settings
**Routing Logic**: Smart navigation ensures a smooth user experience, preventing redirect loops and guiding users to character creation or settings when necessary.

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework**: Express.js on Node.js with TypeScript (ESM modules).
**API Design**: RESTful endpoints proxying requests to OpenRouter's API, including model fetching, chat completions, and streaming chat completions via Server-Sent Events (SSE).
**API Key Management**: Uses a fallback chain for OpenRouter API keys: explicit user-provided key ‚Üí OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable ‚Üí OPEN_ROUTER_DEVKEY secret. This allows the application to function without requiring users to provide their own API keys.
**Session Management**: Currently in-memory, with plans for PostgreSQL persistence using an abstracted `IStorage` interface.
**Development Setup**: Vite middleware for HMR, separate production build for client and server.
**Prompt Management System**: Default prompts are stored as markdown files in `/prompts/` folder (primary.md, parser.md, image-character.md, image-location.md, backstory.md). The `/api/prompts/defaults` endpoint serves these defaults, enabling users to customize prompts per session while retaining the ability to reset to defaults via UI buttons in settings.
- **Automatic Backups**: When updating default prompt files, the system automatically creates timestamped backups (e.g., `primary-2025-10-07T06-30-45.md`) before applying changes. Two methods available:
  - **API Endpoint**: `POST /api/prompts/update` with `{ promptType, content }` - creates backup and updates file
  - **CLI Script**: `npx tsx scripts/update-prompt.ts <promptType> <contentFilePath>` - creates backup and updates from file
- **Backup Storage**: All backups are stored in the `/prompts/` directory with descriptive timestamps for easy version tracking and rollback

### Multi-Agent LLM Architecture

The system utilizes multiple specialized LLMs for different tasks:
- **Primary LLM (Narrative Agent)**: Generates rich, immersive narrative responses (200-400 words) using comprehensive game context, formatted in Markdown.
- **Parser LLM (State Extraction Agent)**: Extracts structured game state updates from the narrative responses *after* they are displayed to the player. Updates include character details, health, gold, XP, attributes, status effects, location, inventory, spells, quests, companions, and encountered characters. It also generates brief history recaps.
- **Image Agent**: Generates AI images for characters, NPCs, companions, and locations using Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview model via OpenRouter.
- **Backstory Agent**: Generates rich, structured backstories for NPCs, companions, quests, and locations. Provides narrative depth and world-building context. (Infrastructure complete, integration pending)

**Execution Flow**: Player action ‚Üí Primary LLM streams narrative ‚Üí Parser LLM analyzes narrative and updates game state ‚Üí Image Agent generates visuals (if auto-enabled) ‚Üí Backstory Agent creates narrative context (if auto-enabled) ‚Üí Cost tracking updates.
**Streaming**: Primary LLM uses SSE for real-time text display; other agents use standard request/response.
**Error Handling & Resilience**: Robust JSON parsing handles malformed LLM responses using multiple strategies (code fences, direct parse, balanced-brace scanning). It supports both flat and nested JSON structures, performs type coercion, and uses defensive defaults for UI components. If parsing fails, the game gracefully degrades, continuing with narrative-only updates and logging errors.
**Context Management**: The Primary LLM receives a condensed context package, including all parsed history recaps, recent messages, complete character stats, and current game state, to maintain coherence and reduce token costs. The Backstory Agent receives similar context plus specific entity information.
**Rationale**: This architecture optimizes cost-per-turn by using powerful models for creative tasks and efficient models for structured data extraction, while enhancing UX through immediate narrative display and rich world-building.
**System Prompts**: All agent prompts are customizable in settings, with default prompts stored as markdown files in `/prompts/` folder (primary.md, parser.md, image-character.md, image-location.md, backstory.md). Users can modify prompts per session and reset to defaults via "Reset to Default" buttons in the settings UI.

### Data Storage Solutions

**IndexedDB Storage (Primary)**: All game data is stored in browser IndexedDB using Dexie.js for better storage capacity (50-100MB+) and performance. Each game has a unique session ID in the URL (e.g., `/?session=abc123`).
- **Database**: Single `DnDAdventureDB` database with `sessions` table, where each session is a separate record keyed by `sessionId`
- **Session ID**: 10-character unique identifier generated using nanoid, stored in URL
- **Session Data**: Each session record contains complete game state, config, cost tracker, turn snapshots, and metadata
- **localStorage Migration**: Automatically migrates legacy localStorage data to IndexedDB on first load, then removes old data
- **Multi-Session Support**: Multiple session records can coexist in IndexedDB - users can switch between games via URL session parameter
- **New Game Cleanup**: Clicking "New Game" deletes the current session from IndexedDB before creating a new one with fresh ID
- **Storage Display**: UI shows current session size (resets on new game), total number of saved sessions, and overall IndexedDB usage
- **Base64 Protection**: Comprehensive sanitization prevents base64 image data from being stored in debug logs or turn snapshots - only R2 URLs are persisted

**Image Storage (Cloudflare R2)**: AI-generated images are stored in Cloudflare R2 cloud storage to prevent localStorage quota issues.
- **Storage Service**: Uses AWS S3-compatible API via @aws-sdk/client-s3
- **Filename Convention**: Structured filenames for easy identification and session tracking
  - Characters: `char_[age]-[sex]-[race]-[job]-[mood]_[sessionId]_[timestamp].jpg`
  - Companions: `comp_[age]-[sex]-[race]-[job]-[mood]_[sessionId]_[timestamp].jpg`
  - NPCs: `npc_[age]-[sex]-[race]-[job]-[mood]_[sessionId]_[timestamp].jpg`
  - Locations: `loc_[environment]-[timeOfDay]-[weather]-[region]-[vibe]_[sessionId]_[timestamp].jpg`
- **Upload Flow**: Base64 image from LLM ‚Üí Backend converts to Buffer ‚Üí Upload to R2 ‚Üí Return public URL
- **Configuration**: R2 credentials stored in Replit secrets (R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID, R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, R2_ENDPOINT, R2_BUCKET_NAME)
- **Rationale**: Eliminates localStorage quota errors caused by large base64 images, enables persistent image storage across sessions

**Future**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations.
**Schema Design**: `GameState` (character stats, inventory, spells, quests, companions, narrative, parsed recaps), `GameConfig` (LLM selections, API keys, custom prompts), `CostTracker`, `GameCharacter`, `Spell`, `Companion`, `EncounteredCharacter`.
