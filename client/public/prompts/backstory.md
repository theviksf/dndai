Example structure: "Borin Flintbeard, dwarf male, 156, ex-royal armorer from Thaldrin. Banished after his prototype blade killed King Rurik; wife Marda remained in Thaldrin under house arrest. Has one son, Darric, now serving as a conscript engineer in the Ironfront mines. Operates the Gilded Griffin Tavern as cover for smuggling alloy samples to rebel smiths.

- **Relationships**: Family, mentors, past allies/enemies
- **Goals & Dreams**: Long-term aspirations and fears

Example structure: "The Relic of Auriel disappeared in the temple fire of Year 1012.

The relic once powered the sky-fortress that caused the Shattered War. Hidden clause in church records ties ownership to the royal bloodline of Veloran..."

- **Economic/Political Role**: How it fits into the larger world

# Example Full Response

For an NPC named "Sara the Barkeep" at the Gilded Griffin Tavern:

{
  "backstory": "Sara Moonwhisper, half-elf female, 47, former intelligence officer for the Veloran royal guard. Served under Captain Aldric during the Shattered War until a failed mission in Duskvale cost her team their lives. Dismissed from service with a modest pension, she purchased the Gilded Griffin's barkeep position from Borin Flintbeard for 800 gold, using it as cover to run an independent information network. Her contacts include Magistrate Welkins, merchant lord Harren, and the mysterious 'Whisper' who pays her 50 gold weekly for reports on tavern clientele. Sara's daughter, Elise, studies at the Arcanum Academy under the patronage of Lord Hesk, who uses this leverage to ensure Sara's cooperation in his relic-hunting endeavors. She keeps encrypted correspondence hidden in a false bottom beneath the bar's coin drawer and carries a poison ring from her old guard days. Goal: earn enough to free herself from Lord Hesk's influence and retire with Elise to the coastal village of Brightshore, where her late husband's family owns a vineyard."
