2. NPC

Borin Flintbeard, dwarf male, 156, ex-royal armorer from Thaldrin. Banished after his prototype blade killed King Rurik; wife Marda remained in Thaldrin under house arrest. Has one son, Darric, now serving as a conscript engineer in the Ironfront mines. Operates the Gilded Griffin Tavern as cover for smuggling alloy samples to rebel smiths. Goal: rebuild fortune to ransom his family and forge a weapon worthy of absolution. Keeps coded ledgers hidden in cask #12 and a blood-sealed letter addressed to the king’s assassin. Suspects one tavern employee spies for the crown.

3. Party Member

Lyra Valen, human female, fighter level 5. Born in Fort Kareth to a disgraced officer and a mercenary healer. Served under Captain Merrin during the Siege of Karvos; blames herself for his death and carries his signet ring. Goal: earn command in a legitimate army and clear her family name. Secret addiction to battle stim herbs from Duskvale. Keeps contact with ex-lover Sera, now an informant in Highspire’s guard. Dreams of founding a neutral mercenary guild; fears emotional betrayal more than death.

4. Quest

The Relic of Auriel disappeared in the temple fire of Year 1012. Highspire clergy seek recovery to regain influence; the Arcanum Council wants containment; collector Lord Hesk offers bounty. Energy readings place it beneath the flooded catacombs. The relic once powered the sky-fortress that caused the Shattered War. Hidden clause in church records ties ownership to the royal bloodline of Veloran. Failure may trigger reactivation of dormant war constructs guarding the site.

5. Location

Gilded Griffin Tavern, Highspire Market District, capacity 60. Built on ruins of the western watchtower; sub-basement connects to pre-war tunnels. Owned by Borin Flintbeard, managed by Sara the Barkeep, entertainer Thom the Bard (rumored Auriel cult courier). Generates ~750 gp/week net. Used by noble House Verrin for secret trade talks. Fire insurance held through the Black Ledger Bank, suggesting criminal ties. A sealed door in the cellar bears military warding sigils older than the city itself.
