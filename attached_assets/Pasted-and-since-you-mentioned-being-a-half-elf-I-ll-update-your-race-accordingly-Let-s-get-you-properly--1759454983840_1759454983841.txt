### Adventure Introduction: *The Whispering Woods*
The sun sets over the quiet hamlet of Oakhaven, casting long shadows through the cobbled streets. You, Jeff the half-elf wizard, have arrived here seeking answers. Rumors speak of ancient elven ruins hidden deep within the Whispering Woods, said to hold forgotten arcane secrets—and perhaps a connection to your mixed heritage. The air is thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, and the distant howl of a wolf echoes through the twilight.

Your companions, gathered at the *Drunken Stag* inn, await your lead:

- **Lyra (F, 28)**, a sharp-eyed human ranger with a mysterious past and a knack for tracking. Her leather armor is worn but well-cared-for, and she keeps a hand near her bowstring.  
- **Thrain (M, 45)**, a stout dwarven cleric of Moradin, his beard braided with iron rings and a holy symbol gleaming at his chest. He grumbles about the "elf nonsense" but hasn't left your side.  
- **Kaelen (M, 24)**, a charismatic half-elf bard with a quick smile and a lute slung over his shoulder. He’s already charming the innkeeper for free drinks.  

A hush falls over the common room as an elderly woman, **Mara (F, 70)**, approaches your table. Her eyes are milky with age, but her voice is steady. "Strangers," she says, "the woods have grown restless. My grandson ventured in three days ago and never returned. If you seek the old stones, find him—and heed the whispers. They say the trees themselves have begun to speak."
